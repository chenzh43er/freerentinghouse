Do you wanna know how to apply for Section 8  housing online and how to qualify for it? Let's have a look together!</p>\n<img alt=\"How Can I Apply For Section 8 Online And Qualify For It_1\" class=\"old_img\" src=\"./Public/Images/postImg/how-can-i-apply-for-section-8-online-and-qualify-for-it_1.webp\"/>\n<h4>1. What Is Section 8</h4>\n<p>Created by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Section 8 refers to a section of federal subsidized housing. It aims to assist low-income families, disabled households as well as the elderly and afford them a clean and safe home in the private sector. You will be provided with a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) after being deemed eligible for the Section 8 program by your local Public Housing Authority (PHA). </p>\n<h4>2. 4 Steps To Apply For Section 8 Online</h4>\n<p>First, contact your  local PHA. This is the easiest and most direct way to find Section 8 housing. You can obtain a Section 8 housing choice voucher on the website of that Housing Authority. For the application, you can either fill it by hand or fill it out online.</p>\n<p>Second, register for a waitlist. The online Section 8 housing application may require you to create a profile. You need to register your basic information such as name, email address and phone number.</p>\n<p>Third, begin the initial application process. To identify the initial eligibility and confirm the identity of an applicant, you will be asked a series of questions such as: current address, family members, employment, income, additional contacts and value of assets. </p>\n<p>Fourth, confirm your email address. Follow the instructions in your email to confirm your application. Remember to check your email for any updates.</p>\n<h4>3. 4 Qualifications To Receive Section 8</h4>\n<p>First, describe your type of household. According to HUD, a family is described as one or more persons who live together. It's worth noting that there is no blood relation required to be considered a family. Individual, single people and roommates can all be considered a family by HUD.</p>\n<p>Second, report your financial status. Three basic levels are involved to determine applicant's income level:</p>\n<p>Extremely low-income: Households that have an income level that is 30% of the area's median income levels. </p>\n<p>Very Low-income: applicants whose income is 50% of the area's median income.</p>\n<p>Low-income: applicants whose income equal  80% of the area's median income levels.</p>\n<p>Third, verify your citizenship status. Only U.S. citizens or people who have eligible immigration status qualify for Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers. </p>\n<p>Fourth, describe your background, rental and criminal history. If any of your family member has one of the following records, you will be automatically disqualified:</p>\n<p>Being convicted of drug related crimes and evicted from a property in the last 3 years</p>\n<p>Being convicted of manufacturing methamphetamines in subsidized housing</p>\n<p>Requiring a lifelong registration as a sex offender</p>\n</div>",

Here we will explore where to find affordable housing and give you some tips.</p>\n<img alt=\"Where To Find Affordable Rental Housing?_1\" class=\"old_img\" src=\"./Public/Images/postImg/where-to-find-affordable-rental-housing_1.webp\"/>\n<h4>1. Contact Your Local Housing Authority</h4>\n<p>Affordable housing programs and waiting lists are often operated by housing authorities. They are aware of the buildings and apartments available as affordable rentals. Try to search by county to learn more information.</p>\n<h4>2. Preferences And Discrimination</h4>\n<p class=\"newline\">When the housing offices put the applicants on a waiting list, they ought to give priority to the disadvantaged groups (children, senior citizens and the disabled). But when it comes to choosing a rental, any type of preference or discrimination is prohibited by Fair Housing Act.<br/>\n</p>\n<h4>3. Directly Turn To A Landlord On The Rental Market</h4>\n<p>If an applicant has joined the Housing Choice Voucher Program (or Section 8), it is possible to find a landlord on the rental market and ask if the voucher is acceptable. It is a good idea when you have found a rental in advance, but not all the rentals have joined the Section 8 Program.</p>\n<h4>4. Look For 2 Bedroom Affordable Apartments?</h4>\n<p>Rent assistance or housing vouchers often bring with them some restrictions. In most cases, the housing voucher would determine what type of affordable housing is available. If you are a household of 2 people, you would be eligible only for 2 bedroom apartments.</p>\n<h4>5. Discount Amount</h4>\n<p>According to the income of the applicant (for instance, 50%~80% of the AMI), the housing voucher would pay for 50% to 70% of housing rent. However, there exists a minimum amount for rent. While choosing a rental, take the price into consideration.</p>\n<h4>6. A Reasonable Landlord</h4>\n<p>Affordable housing programs give tenants more privacy and freedom to deal with their rooms. So long as the tenants pay the rent in time and do not destroy properties, the landlord can not evict the tenant. Choose a reasonable landlord carefully to avoid trouble.</p>\n<h4>7. Act Quickly</h4>\n<p>The duration of a Section 8 Voucher is 60/90/120 days, depending on the housing authority. To avoid letting their voucher expire, the applicants need to act quickly to gather information.</p>\n</div>",

What's Section 8 Housing?</h4>\n<p>The Housing Choice Voucher Program, often known as Section ­8, is a support system provided by the U.S. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Development (HUD) to help low-income families, the elderly, and people with disabilities afford low-cost apartments that are safe and hygienic.</p>\n<h4>2. What's Low-Income Housing?</h4>\n<p>Low-income housing provides assistance to renters whose household income is less than 80% of the regional median. Those who are unable to keep up with rising rents and changing consumer trends benefit from low-income housing.</p>\n<h4>3. Are They The Same Thing?</h4>\n<p>Although Section 8 housing and low-income housing are often used interchangeably, they are not the same thing. Actually, Section 8 housing is just one of many low-income housing options, and not all low-income housing is Section 8.</p>\n<h4>4. Low-Income Housing Assistance Apart From Section 8</h4>\n<p>In addition to the well-known Section 8 housing and public housing, low-income housing also includes many other programs such as Low Income Housing Tax Credits, Tenant-based rental assistance (TBRA) programs, Project-based rental assistance programs, The HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME), Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and so on.</p>\n<h4>5. Type Of Assistance</h4>\n<p>Section 8 housing provides assistance through vouchers. Renters who participate in Section 8 housing are given vouchers to deliver to participating landlords. Low-income housing like public housing allows eligible renters to enjoy discounts or even free of charge directly.</p>\n<h4>6. The Rental Housing</h4>\n<p>Under Section 8 housing, you can rent from any private landlord who takes section 8 vouchers if you have one. However, low-income housing may be limited to state-operated buildings, which means you should choose government-only housing covered by this program.</p>\n</div>",
