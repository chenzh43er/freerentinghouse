  <h4>1. What is Section 8?</h4>
  <div id="adv3"></div>
  <p>Section 8 is a program created by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to provide government-subsidized housing. It helps low-income families, people with disabilities, and seniors find safe and clean homes in the private rental market. If you're deemed eligible, you'll receive a Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) from your local Public Housing Agency (PHA).</p>

  <h4>2. 4 Steps to Apply for Section 8 Online</h4>
  <p>Step 1: Contact your local Public Housing Agency (PHA). This is the easiest and most direct way to find Section 8 housing. You can apply for a voucher through their website — either in person or online.</p>
  <p>Step 2: Sign up for the waiting list. The online Section 8 application typically requires creating a user profile. You'll need to provide basic information such as your name, email address, and phone number.</p>
  <p>Step 3: Start the pre-application process. To check basic eligibility, you’ll be asked questions about your current address, household members, employment, income, other contacts, and assets.</p>
  <p>Step 4: Confirm your email address. Follow the instructions in the email to verify your application. Check your email regularly for updates.</p>

  <h4>3. 4 Requirements for Section 8 Eligibility</h4>
  <p>Requirement 1: Describe your household type. According to HUD, a family is one or more people living together — not necessarily related. Individuals and roommates can also qualify.</p>
  <p>Requirement 2: Provide your financial situation. Income is categorized as follows:</p>
  <p>Extremely low income: 30% of the area median income</p>
  <p>Very low income: 50% of the area median income</p>
  <p>Low income: 80% of the area median income</p>
  <p>Requirement 3: Disclose your citizenship status. Only U.S. citizens or eligible immigrants can receive Section 8 assistance.</p>
  <p>Requirement 4: Provide your background history, especially rental and criminal records. You will be disqualified if a household member has any of the following:</p>
  <p>Drug convictions and evictions within the past 3 years</p>
  <p>Conviction for producing methamphetamine in subsidized housing</p>
  <p>Lifetime registration on a sex offender list</p>
